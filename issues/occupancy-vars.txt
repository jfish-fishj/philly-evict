Here are some basic issues im having with the occupancy vars and blp estimation:

1. little variation in shares
2. infousa household counts mostly but not entirely agree with the imputed units. often there are large apartments with no people or addresses with many people that dont match a rental property. sometimes, this is because the rental license is registered to an admin building that doesnt have any people, but often it's a sign that the unit imputation is going crazy. ideally, it should be the case that total units are very correlated with households, especially for larger apartments. we definitely dont want a lot of cases where there is big disagreement
3. bad unit imputation and occupancy assignment messes up filing counts and eventual shares
4. Price-per-unit from RTT transfers should be reasonably similar across building types (within the same neighborhood/year). If high-rises that get assigned too few units mechanically have inflated filing rates AND inflated price-per-unit, that's a sign total_units is wrong — not that they're actually more expensive or higher-evicting per unit. Cross-check: compare median(price_per_unit) across building_type bins in the RTT analysis and flag cases where high-rise price/unit is way above midrise/lowrise within the same block group.
