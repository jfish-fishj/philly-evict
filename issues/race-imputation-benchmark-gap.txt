Race imputation benchmark gap (Lodermeier contrast)

Date opened: 2026-02-17

Problem statement
- Under paper-like case classification standards, current pipeline output remains below the expected Black share benchmark for classified cases.
- We expected roughly 60-70% Black in filed-eviction case composition; current estimate is materially lower.

Current evidence
- Comparison outputs:
  - output/qa/lodermeier_benchmark_compare_2006_2019.csv
  - output/qa/lodermeier_benchmark_coverage_2006_2019.csv
  - output/qa/lodermeier_renter_benchmark_compare_2010.csv
  - output/qa/lodermeier_sensitivity_defendant1_vs_all_2006_2019.csv
- Under the current contrast run:
  - Black share among classified cases: ~57.53%
  - White share among classified cases: ~29.32%
  - Unclassified share: ~26.18%
- Defendant #1-only sensitivity:
  - Black share among classified rises to ~58.61%, still below benchmark.

Why this matters
- Race composition is a core descriptive and validation output.
- If this gap is unresolved, downstream interpretation of discrimination and targeting patterns may be biased or not directly comparable to published work.

Likely causes to investigate
1) Sample-frame mismatch
- Year range, case universe, and filing inclusion criteria may differ from benchmark source.

2) Classification denominator mismatch
- Classified-only vs all-cases denominator handling may differ.

3) Residual role contamination
- Defendant role handling may still differ from benchmark conventions, including Defendant #2 and counterclaim dynamics.

4) Name-parser / cleaning edge cases
- Remaining parser errors can reallocate probability mass across non-Black categories.

5) Prior geography/vintage mismatch
- BG vs tract priors, renter vs total-pop priors, and vintage alignment may affect posterior composition.

6) Benchmark extraction uncertainty
- Some benchmark percentages were carried from extraction notes and should be re-verified against the exact final paper table.

Action plan
1) Freeze a strict benchmark-replication spec in one script:
- exact year window
- denominator definition
- case inclusion/exclusion logic
- role filtering logic

2) Re-verify benchmark source values directly from the paper and archive them in-repo as a reference table.

3) Add one QA report that decomposes composition shifts stepwise:
- all defendants
- analysis defendants
- Defendant #1 only
- classified-only cases
- by year bands

4) Audit top discrepant race groups:
- quantify why Hispanic/Asian/Other-Mixed are elevated relative to benchmark.

5) Add a go/no-go check:
- fail QA if Black-share gap exceeds threshold (for the agreed benchmark spec).

Definition note
- This issue is diagnostic and QA-focused; it should not silently change scientific definitions without explicit sign-off.
