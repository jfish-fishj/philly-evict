# Repo Skills for Codex / CLI agents

These skills are small, reusable workflows that help the agent behave consistently in this repo.

How to use:
- Keep this directory in your repo at `.agents/skills/`.
- Invoke by name in your prompt (e.g., "Use the `join-safety` skill..."), or let Codex auto-select.
- Customize any SKILL.md to match your exact commands, paths, and data products.
