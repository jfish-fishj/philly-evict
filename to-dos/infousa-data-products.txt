InfoUSA Data Products — To-Do List
===================================

1) Past Address Diagnostics
---------------------------
Goal: Use InfoUSA panel structure to track individuals across addresses over
time and characterize the movers vs stayers.

What this should do:
- For each familyid, construct a complete address history (sequence of
  n_sn_ss_c / PID by year).
- Report tracking rates: how many families can we follow for 2+ years?
  5+ years? What's the median spell length?
- Among movers (address changes), characterize:
    - Property observables at origin vs destination (unit count, building type,
      rent level, filing rate, owner)
    - Neighborhood observables (BG racial composition, tract income, etc.)
    - Direction of moves: upgrading vs downgrading on rent/quality?
    - Distance of moves (same zip? same tract? cross-city? out of city?)
- Compare movers vs stayers on observables: are movers younger, in smaller
  buildings, at higher-eviction properties?
- Validate against address-history-analysis.R (which currently runs a subset
  of this for eviction persistence regressions) — this would be the more
  comprehensive descriptive version.

Key questions:
- What fraction of households can we reliably track across multiple addresses?
- Is there systematic attrition (e.g., do we lose low-income renters faster)?
- How does move frequency correlate with eviction exposure?


2) Complete InfoUSA Data (Out-of-Philly Linkage)
-------------------------------------------------
Goal: The current InfoUSA extract is a repeated cross-section of Philly
parcels only. If a household moves out of Philadelphia (or into Philly from
elsewhere), we lose them. This task would link Philly familyids to the
broader InfoUSA universe to recover those moves.

What this should do:
- Start with all unique familyids observed in the Philly extract.
- Query the broader InfoUSA data (full PA file, or at minimum the
  Philadelphia MSA / surrounding counties: Montgomery, Delaware, Bucks,
  Chester, Camden, Burlington, Gloucester).
- For each familyid, check whether they appear at non-Philly addresses in
  years where they're missing from the Philly extract.
- Report:
    - How many familyids have out-of-Philly spells?
    - What fraction of "disappearances" from the Philly panel are explained
      by moves to nearby counties vs true attrition (death, data dropout)?
    - Geographic distribution of out-of-Philly moves (which counties/zips?)
    - Return rates: of those who leave, how many come back?
- This is a data acquisition + linkage task — need to determine what broader
  InfoUSA files are available and whether familyid is stable across extracts.

Key questions:
- Is familyid a household ID or a person ID? Does it persist across moves?
- What broader InfoUSA geography do we have access to?
- How many of our "censored" spells (family disappears from Philly panel)
  are actually suburban moves vs genuine attrition?
