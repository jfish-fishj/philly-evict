\paragraph{What I worked on}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Cleaned eviction data
    \item Cleaned altos data
    \item Finished xwalk of eviction-parcel and altos-parcel data
    \item noodled
    \item made a couple descriptives
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{things I learned}
\begin{itemize}
    \item names in eviction data suck. basic issue is that a lot of the names have non standard spellings or have stuck / unstuck (e.g, joe fish l lc; phila delphia hou sing authoirity), which makes doing name analysis tought
    \item pretty big differences in filings thresholds (median amount back rent at time of filing) by landlord type (llc, high evicting land lords, lol the housing authority has no chill)
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{to-dos}
\begin{itemize}
    \item clean the names more. maybe chat gpt some of them?
\end{itemize}
