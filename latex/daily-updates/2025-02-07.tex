\paragraph{What I worked on}
\begin{itemize}
    \item too many meetings
    \item noodling on ideas 
    \item met with pat (two days ago), met with jaimie, met with fun time study friends
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{things I learned}
\begin{itemize}
    \item paper by winnie van dijk basically does the paper allan wanted. here's a sketch of their stylized facts w/ some ledger data from a Midwest low income landlord: 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \url{https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/ttfuwljadd6iwbkmwf45g/Nonpayment_and_Eviction.pdf?rlkey=v872x6cavh8cjzybzj6pg3z2f&e=4&st=6eumcbqm&dl=0}
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \paragraph{stylized facts}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item most evictions for non-payment of rent; similar two months backrent median to what elab finds
        \item non-payment of rent is very common
        \item landlords tolerate non-payment of rent because subsequent repayment is common enough
    \end{itemize}
    \item \paragraph{stylized model}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item tenants draw from CDF of probabilities of payment in a month
        \item based on draw, tenants do / don't pay
        \item landlords form posteriors over tenant's ability to pay in the future
        \item landlords have value function based on tenants observed state;  decide whether to evict if some threshold is crossed
    \end{itemize}
    \item \paragraph{model delivers}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item high rent prices for shitty units as risk premia
        \item relative ineffectiveness for some common anti-eviction policies (filing fees, rent support, right to counsel). Companion paper also shows pass through of tenant protections onto prices
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \url{https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/hhc3pipg9x0jwtq5adjlm/RTC.pdf?rlkey=qky6pxy9oqe3ei39c3hm0fhjw&e=1&st=8byxwhnq&dl=0}
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
    
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{to-dos}
\begin{itemize}
    \item i need to figure out where my ideas fit in with what they do. i think they're missing some landlord heterogeneity that might be useful.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item landlord heterogeneity-- few landlords do most evictions
        \item cross sectional differences in filing rates
        \item what explains racial differences in filing rates? (paper showing mostly statistical discrimination is tough)
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
