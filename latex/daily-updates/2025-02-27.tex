\paragraph{What I worked on}
\begin{itemize}
    \item got a model sketch (see scratch)
    \item name cleaning still work in progress
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{things I learned}
\begin{itemize}
    \item models are hard :(
    \begin{itemize}
        \item basically, getting eviction to matter as this economic wedge is tricky. for instance, what does being able to evict much faster allow landlords? it's clear what slower evictions give tenants, but not clear on other side. need to think more...
    \end{itemize}
    \item pretty large amount of consolidation in low income rentals even without any fancy owner matching. basic idea is to segment market by zip code + whether the property ever filed for eviction as proxy for low income rental
    \begin{itemize}
        \item you get a large number of zip codes with pretty substantial concentration without doing any fancy name matching
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{to-dos}
\begin{itemize}
    \item write up pitch deck
    \item make the rental panel
\end{itemize}
