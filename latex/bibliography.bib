In our granular setting, large employers remove their own job postings from their workers’ outside option. Thus, size gives market power and a more concentrated market structure depresses wages because it reduces competition for workers. We calibrate the model to Austrian data and find that such size-based market power depresses wages by about 2.6\% or 1,500 euros annually per worker.},

Meanwhile, the crime rate also significantly decreases in overlapped neighborhoods after mergers. Our findings suggest that while institutional landlords leverage their market power to extract greater surplus from renters, they also improve the quality of rental services by enhancing neighborhood safety.Authors have furnished an Internet Appendix, which is available on the Oxford University Press Web site next to the link to the final published paper online.},

 abstract = {Recent research has documented the prevalence and consequences of evictions in the United States, but our understanding of the drivers of eviction and the scope for policy to reduce evictions remains limited. We use novel lease-level ledger data from high-eviction rental markets to characterize key determinants of landlord eviction decisions: the persistence of shocks to tenant default risk, landlords' information about these shocks, and landlords' costs of eviction. Our data show that nonpayment is common, is often tolerated by landlords, and is often followed by recovery, suggesting that landlords face a trade-off between initiating a costly eviction or waiting to learn whether a tenant can continue paying. We develop and estimate a dynamic discrete choice model of the eviction decision that captures this trade-off. Estimated eviction costs are on the order of 2 to 3 months of rent, and the majority of evictions involve tenants who are unlikely to pay going forward. As a result, while commonly-proposed policies can generate additional forbearance for tenants, they do not prevent most evictions. Compared to policies that create delays in the eviction process, increasing filing fees or providing short-term rent subsidies are more likely to prevent evictions of tenants who would resume paying.}

 abstract = {Eviction may be an important channel for the intergenerational transmission of poverty, and concerns about its effects on children are often raised as a rationale for tenant protection policies. We study how eviction impacts children's home environment, school engagement, educational achievement, and high school completion by assembling new data sets linking eviction court records in Chicago and New York to administrative public school records and restricted Census records. To disentangle the consequences of eviction from the effects of correlated sources of economic distress, we use a research design based on the random assignment of court cases to judges who vary in their leniency. We find that eviction increases children's residential mobility, homelessness, and likelihood of doubling up with grandparents or other adults. Eviction also disrupts school engagement, causing increased absences and school changes. While we find little impact on elementary and middle school test scores, eviction substantially reduces high school course credits. Lastly, we find that eviction reduces high school graduation and use a novel bounding method to show that this finding is not driven by differential attrition. The disruptive effects of eviction appear worse for older children and boys. Our evidence suggests that the impact of eviction on children runs through the disruption to the home environment or school engagement rather than deterioration in school or neighborhood quality, and may be moderated by access to family support networks.},
